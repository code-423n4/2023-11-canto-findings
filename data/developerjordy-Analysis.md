### Approach taken:

The evaluation of the codebase involved a thorough review of the smart contracts, focusing on understanding the overall architecture, code quality, security mechanisms, and the presence of any centralization or systemic risks. The review included static analysis, codebase walkthroughs, and testing scenarios to identify potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.

### Architecture Feedback:
Best practise should be followed for functions according to their visibility:
    1. Constructor
    2. Receive Functions (if exists)
    3. Fallback function (if exists)
    4. External
    5. Public 
    6. Internal
    7. Private. 
    8. View and Pure function last

### Centralization Risks:
**Centralization Risk in Share Creation**: The current implementation restricts share creation to authorized wallets, posing a centralization risk.

### Systemic Risks
**Front-Running and Market Manipulation**: The current market mechanism is susceptible to front-running, particularly in the context of share buying. Implement global tx counter, so the tx reverts when wrong tx count is giving in function parameter.

### Other Recommendations:
Improving the documentation within the unit tests is recommended to enhance understandability and maintainability of the test code. Add Foundry fuzz tests to test with random and large function inputs. 

### Time Spent:
Approximately 32 hours were spent on this analysis, including review of the codebase, architecture, and writing this report.
