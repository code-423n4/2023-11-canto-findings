# 1155tech-contract

## General Comments 

1. Immutable `token` Address: `token` is set in the constructor and that cannot be changed after that. It would be good to check any possibility of changes of `asD` address and upgradability of `1155tech` contracts in that case.

2. Reentrancy: The contract should be safe from reentrancy in its current form, but considering adding reentrancy guards (ReentrancyGuard from OpenZeppelin) to functions that perform external calls (buy, sell, mintNFT, burnNFT of `Market` contract) is recommended.


# asD

## General Comments

1. Input Validation: It would be good to ensure inputs to functions, especially publicly callable ones, are validated as needed. For example, `mint`, `burn`, and `withdrawCarry` can filter out the case of `_amount == 0` with having `require(_amount != 0, "zero amount is not allowed");`.

2. Reentrancy: The contract should be safe from reentrancy in its current form, but adding ReentrancyGuard is recommended for functions making external calls.

3. Documentation: It would be better to ensure comprehensive NatSpec comments for better readability and maintainability.

4. Emit Events: Currently, `mint` and `burn` of `asD` contract do not have specific event emissions. It would be better to emit specific events.
