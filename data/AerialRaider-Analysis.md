audit findings for the smart contracts in question:

Whitelisting or Blacklisting Bonding Curves in the Market Contract: This aspect carries a medium risk. The Market contract's ability to whitelist or blacklist bonding curves impacts the creation of new shares. This flexibility is crucial for managing the types of bonding curves that can be used, potentially affecting the token's market behavior.

Dynamic Pricing Mechanism in LinearBondingCurve: The getPriceAndFee function of the LinearBondingCurve contract also presents a medium risk. This dynamic pricing mechanism adjusts prices based on various market factors, influencing the buy and sell prices of tokens. While this can be beneficial for adapting to market conditions, it also introduces complexities and potential vulnerabilities.

Effective Fee Management in the getSellPrice Function:  The management and calculation of fees during the selling of shares need to be effective to avoid disincentivizing sales, especially in low liquidity conditions.

Implementing Emergency Circuit Breakers in Market.sol: The inclusion of emergency mechanisms like circuit breakers in the Market contract is crucial for mitigating risks in extreme scenarios. This also is marked as medium risk, as it's essential for protecting the system and users under unforeseen circumstances.

Maintaining a 1:1 Peg Between the asD Token and the NOTE: Ensuring this peg within the asD contract is vital for the stability and trust in the asD token. It involves carefully managing the relationship between minted asD tokens and the underlying NOTE, particularly during the interest withdrawal by the contract owner.

Quality Assurance: The overall quality assurance process has been conducted to ensure the contracts are robust, secure, and function as intended. This is a continuous process, aiming to identify and rectify any potential issues or improvements in the contracts' design and implementation.
