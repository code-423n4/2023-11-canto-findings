If amount is == 0 we should manage that function withdrawCarry(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
    uint256 exchangeRate = CTokenInterface(cNote).exchangeRateCurrent();
    uint256 maximumWithdrawable = (CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOf(address(this)) * exchangeRate) / 1e28 - totalSupply();

    require(_amount <= maximumWithdrawable, "Too many tokens requested");

    if (_amount == 0) {
        _amount = maximumWithdrawable;
        if (_amount == 0) {
            // There's nothing to withdraw, emit an event or handle the case as appropriate
            emit NoTokensToWithdraw();
            return;
        }
    }

    uint256 returnCode = CErc20Interface(cNote).redeemUnderlying(_amount);
    require(returnCode == 0, "Error when redeeming");

    IERC20 note = IERC20(CErc20Interface(cNote).underlying());
    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(note, msg.sender, _amount);
    emit CarryWithdrawal(_amount);
}

We check if _amount is zero after verifying if it exceeds maximumWithdrawable. If _amount is zero, we assign it the value of maximumWithdrawable.
Immediately after that assignment, we check if _amount is still zero. If it is, we handle this scenario by emitting an event (NoTokensToWithdraw) or performing any other required action. Then, we exit the function early using return.
This explicit handling ensures that when _amount is zero and there are no tokens to withdraw, the function doesn't execute unnecessary code and takes appropriate action for this specific scenario.
